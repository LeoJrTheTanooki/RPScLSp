#### Name Leo Garcia
#### Project Name: Eight to Ten
#### Date: 1/20/2023
#### Description: A website where you can play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock against a computer or against another player (Local only)
#### Peer Reviewer: Zachary Dressel
#### Review Notes: The background behind the game container is well made, and the color scheme chosen works really well. Im not a big fan of the everpresent rules and lack of visual clarity on what choices were made but the function of the game works perfect and the design is followed through upon on all aspects of the project.
Code is well spaced in Inspect, however I would remove the code that is commented out as it does not do anything. Overall Great!
